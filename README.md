# Weather-Forecast
## Intro
This project provides users with a convenient way to access accurate and up-to-date weather information based on their preferences and chosen locations.

## 4. Metrics
I integrated [SonarCloud](https://sonarcloud.io/projects?reliability=1) with GitHub Actions to analyze my project's metrics, with the goal of enhancing its performance and overall quality.

## 5. Clean Code Development

## 6. Build Management
I have employed [PyBuilder](https://github.com/homa-ae/Weather-Forecast/blob/main/build.py)  to manage the build process of the project.   
The build process will be initiated using the 
<kbd style="background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">
pyb --verbose
</kbd>
command.   
This command will provide comprehensive details, including the outcomes of individual tests, identifying both those that passed successfully and those that failed.  
Additionally, the command will indicate whether the overall build process was successful or encountered any issues.

## 9. IDE
I'm particularly fond of 
<kbd style="font-size: 20px; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px; background-color: #f0f0f0;">
#### Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
</kbd>
, my all-time favourite IDE. This widely-used, free, and open-source code editor appeals to me for several reasons:
* VS Code supports a wide range of programming languages.
* It provides IntelliSense, an intelligent code completion feature that offers suggestions and auto-completions as you type.
* This lightweight IDE includes built-in support for debugging code, lets you find and fix mistakes in your code easily. 
* It has built-in support for version control systems like Git, allowing you to manage your source code repositories directly within the editor.
* In Visual Studio Code, you can split the editor to see different files or parts of the same file side by side, helping you compare and work on multiple sections at once,     which makes managing your code easier.

Here are some preferred keyboard shortcuts commonly used in Visual Studio Code:

* Ctrl + S (Cmd + S on macOS): Save the current file.  
* Ctrl + Z (Cmd + Z on macOS): Undo the last action.  
* Ctrl + Shift + Z (Cmd + Shift + Z on macOS): Redo the last undone action.  
* Ctrl + X (Cmd + X on macOS): Cut the selected text.  
* Ctrl + C (Cmd + C on macOS): Copy the selected text.  
* Ctrl + V (Cmd + V on macOS): Paste the copied or cut text.  
* Ctrl + F (Cmd + F on macOS): Open the Find dialogue to search for text within the current file.  
* Ctrl + H (Cmd + Option + F on macOS): Open the Replace dialogue to search and replace text within the current file.  
* Ctrl + Shift + F (Cmd + Shift + F on macOS): Open the Find in Files dialogue to search for text across multiple files in the project.  
* Ctrl + G (Cmd + G on macOS): Go to a specific line number within the current file.  
* Ctrl + B (Cmd + B on macOS): Toggle the visibility of the sidebar.  
* Ctrl + P (Cmd + P on macOS): Quick Open, allowing you to quickly navigate to files within the project.  
* Ctrl + ` (Cmd + ` on macOS): Toggle the terminal panel.  
* Ctrl + Shift + E (Cmd + Shift + E on macOS): Focus on the file explorer sidebar.  
* Ctrl + Shift + F5 (Cmd + Shift + F5 on macOS): Restart the debug session.
