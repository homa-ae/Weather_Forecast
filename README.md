## 4. Metrics
I integrated [SonarCloud](https://sonarcloud.io/projects?reliability=1) with GitHub Actions to analyze my project's metrics, with the goal of enhancing its performance and overall quality.

## 5. Clean Code Development

## 6. Build Management
I've employed [PyBuilder](https://github.com/homa-ae/Weather-Forecast/blob/main/build.py)  to manage the build process of the project.   
The build process will be initiated using the 
<kbd style="background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">
pyb --verbose
</kbd>
command.   
This command will provide comprehensive details, including the outcomes of individual tests, identifying both those that passed successfully and those that failed.  
Additionally, the command will indicate whether the overall build process was successful or encountered any issues.
