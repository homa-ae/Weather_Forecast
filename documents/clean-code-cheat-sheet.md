## Clean Code Development Cheatsheet:

1. Descriptive Naming:  
- I employed clear and descriptive variable and function names. So the code ensures readability, following clean code principles.

- 
I applied modularity structure to encapsulate specific tasks into separate functions, promote maintainability and reusability.
Consistent formatting and style choices are used throughout the codebase, contributing to its cleanliness and ease of understanding.

By adhering to consistent formatting conventions, such as indentation, spacing, and naming conventions, the code becomes easier to read and understand. This consistency contributes to the overall cleanliness of the codebase, making it more organized and cohesive. As a result, developers can navigate through the code more efficiently, leading to enhanced comprehension and easier maintenance.

1. Descriptive Naming:
   - Use clear and descriptive variable and function names for improved readability.
   
2. Modularity:
   - Encapsulate specific tasks into separate functions to promote maintainability and reusability.
   
3. Consistent Formatting and Style:
   - Maintain uniformity in indentation, spacing, and naming conventions throughout the codebase.
   - Follow consistent widget placement in the graphical user interface (GUI).
   
4. Comments:
   - Include comments where necessary, following a consistent style, to provide additional clarity and explanation.
     
DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):
   - Avoid duplicating code by encapsulating reusable logic into functions or modules.

(((Yes, your code demonstrates the DRY principle in several ways:

    Function Encapsulation: You encapsulate repetitive tasks into functions. For example, the get_weather() function is responsible for retrieving weather and air pollution data for a given city and updating the GUI with the retrieved information. By encapsulating this functionality into a single function, you avoid duplicating the code needed to fetch and display weather and air pollution data.

    Reusable Components: Within the get_weather() function, you reuse the same logic for handling weather data and air pollution data. Instead of duplicating code for each type of data, you use similar mechanisms to extract relevant information and update the GUI accordingly.

    Consolidated Error Handling: Error handling is centralized within the get_weather() function. Instead of duplicating error handling code throughout the script, you handle exceptions in a single location, promoting consistency and avoiding code duplication.

Overall, your code follows the DRY principle by encapsulating common functionality, reusing components, and consolidating error handling, which leads to more maintainable and efficient code.)))
