### Clean Code Development Cheatsheet:
1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Each function or class should have only one responsibility.
2. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself): Avoid duplicate code by abstracting common functionality into reusable functions or classes.
3. KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid): Strive for simplicity in design and implementation.
4. YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It): Only implement functionality when it's actually needed, not based on speculative requirements.
5. Use Meaningful Comments: Comments should explain why something is done, not what is done (the code should be self-explanatory).
6. Avoid Magic Numbers and Strings: Instead, use constants or enums to make code more readable and maintainable.
7. Unit Tests: Write unit tests to ensure code correctness and facilitate refactoring.
8. Code Reviews: Regularly conduct and participate in code reviews to maintain code quality and share knowledge among team members.
9. Version Control: Use version control systems like Git to track changes and collaborate effectively.
10. Continuous Integration (CI) / Continuous Deployment (CD): Automate testing and deployment processes to ensure code quality and rapid delivery.
