## Clean Code Development Cheatsheet:
1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
   Each function or class should have only one responsibility. This means that a function should have a clear, singular purpose, whether it's performing a calculation,          handling an input, or formatting data. By employing SRP, code becomes more modular, easier to understand, and simpler to maintain, as each component is responsible for     a specific task without unnecessary complexity.
2. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):
   Avoids duplicate code by abstracting common functionality into reusable functions or classes. It emphasizes the importance of avoiding redundancy in code. Instead of          duplicating the same logic or operations in multiple places, DRY encourages consolidating common functionality into reusable components such as functions or classes. By      using DRY, developers minimize code duplication, making the codebase more maintainable, scalable, and easier to modify without introducing inconsistencies.
3. KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid):
   Strives for simplicity in design and implementation. It advocates for simplicity in both design and implementation, and emphasizes the importance of favoring straightforward solutions over complex ones. By following KISS, developers aim to create code and systems that are easy to understand, maintain, and extend, leading to better overall software quality and reduced chances of errors.
4. YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It):
   Only implements functionality when it's actually needed, not based on speculative requirements. It advises developers to refrain from adding features or functionality        until they are deemed necessary. This principle discourages implementing speculative requirements or features that may not be immediately needed. By embracing YAGNI,         developers focus on delivering the essential features required by users, avoiding unnecessary complexity and reducing development time and effort.
   
8. Use Meaningful Comments: Comments should explain why something is done, not what is done (the code should be self-explanatory).
9. Avoid Magic Numbers and Strings: Instead, use constants or enums to make code more readable and maintainable.
10. Unit Tests: Write unit tests to ensure code correctness and facilitate refactoring.
11. Code Reviews: Regularly conduct and participate in code reviews to maintain code quality and share knowledge among team members.
12. Version Control: Use version control systems like Git to track changes and collaborate effectively.
13. Continuous Integration (CI) / Continuous Deployment (CD): Automate testing and deployment processes to ensure code quality and rapid delivery.
