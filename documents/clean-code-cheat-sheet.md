## Clean Code Development Cheatsheet:

1. Descriptive Naming:  
   I employed clear and descriptive variable and function names. So the code ensures readability, following clean code principles.

2. Modularity:
   I applied modularity structure to encapsulate specific tasks into separate functions, promote maintainability and reusability.

3. Consistent Formatting and Style:
   By using consistent formatting conventions, such as indentation, spacing, and naming conventions, my code becomes easier to read and understand.
   So the codebase is simpler to grasp, helping developers find their way around and make changes easily.
   In the GUI, placing widgets in a consistent manner ensures a smoother user experience and helps maintain code clarity and structure.
   
4. Comments:
   My code includes helpful comments and a docstring at the beginning, acting like a user manual, explaining what each part of the code does and how to use it effectively.      This documentation ensures that anyone reading my code can quickly understand its functionality and purpose.
   This approach not only makes it easier for me to maintain and update the code but also encourages collaboration among other developers who may need to work with it in        the future.
   The use of comments and a docstring in the code exemplifies the principles of clean code development by promoting transparency and organization. 

5. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):
   * My code demonstrates the DRY principle in several ways:
   Function Encapsulation: I encapsulated repetitive tasks into functions. For example, the get_weather() function is responsible for retrieving weather and air pollution       data for a given city and updating the GUI with the retrieved information. By encapsulating this functionality into a single function, I avoided duplicating the code         needed to fetch and display weather and air pollution data.
   * Reusable Components: Within the get_weather() function, I reused the same logic for handling weather data and air pollution data. Instead of duplicating code for each        type of data, I used similar mechanisms to extract relevant information and update the GUI accordingly.
   Consolidated Error Handling: Error handling is centralized within the get_weather() function. Instead of duplicating error handling code throughout the script, I handled     exceptions in a single location, promoting consistency and avoiding code duplication.
   * Overall, my code follows the DRY principle by encapsulating common functionality, reusing components, and consolidating error handling, which leads to more maintainable      and efficient code.
